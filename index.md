# CS-499 Computer Science ePortfolio  
## Charles Morales

Welcome to my GitHub Pages ePortfolio for the SNHU CS-499 Computer Science Capstone. This site presents my professional self-assessment, enhanced artifacts, and evidence of the program outcomes.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me
to reflect on my technical growth and my readiness to enter the field.  Throughout the
program, I strengthened my problem-solving skills, improved my ability to write clean 
and maintainable code, and gained experience applying computer science concepts to 
practical problems.  The capstone experience brought these skills together by requiring
me to revisit earlier work, evaluate it critically, and enhance it using professional 
standards.

I developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, software engineering,
and databases through hands-on programming assignments.  These courses helped me
understand how design decisions impact performance, scalability, and maintainability.
I also became more aware of security considerations, learning to write safer code by
validating input, handling data responsibly, and reviewing programs with a security-
focused mindset. 

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio demonstrate the integration of these skills
across multiple areas of computer science.  Each enhancement artifact reflects growth
in design, efficiency, and reliability, and together they showcase my ability to
analyze existing code and improve it thoughtfully.  As a whole, this portfolio
represents my preparation to contribute effectively in a professional computer science
role.

## Enhanced Artifacts

- **Artifact 1 – Software Design & Engineering (Corner Grocer – ItemTracker class)**
  
   The first artifact is the “Corner Grocer” project, originally created for CS 210. The project is a C++ application that tracks the frequency of purchased grocery items by reading a text file and generating item counts. I enhanced this project by restructuring the code and integrating Python for file reading and data processing while retaining C++ for the user interface. This enhancement strengthened my understanding of modular design, encapsulation, and cross-language software development.

- **Artifact 2 – Algorithms & Data Structures (Counter + caching)**
  
  The second artifact builds upon the Corner Grocer project by focusing on algorithm and data structure improvements. I expanded the design introduced in Artifact 1 by implementing an ItemTracker class to improve encapsulation, modularity, and maintainability. These changes provided a clearer foundation for applying efficient algorithms and reinforced my understanding of how data structures impact performance and scalability.

- **Artifact 3 – Databases (SQLite + parameterized queries)**
  
  The third artifact further enhances the Corner Grocer project by incorporating database-related concepts and secure data handling. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to manage stored data effectively while maintaining a focus on reliability and security. By extending the original application, I was able to apply database principles and reinforce the importance of protecting data through responsible design choices.
