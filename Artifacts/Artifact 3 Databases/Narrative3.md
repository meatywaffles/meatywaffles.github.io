CS 499 Capstone Artifact 3

Briefly describe the artifact.  What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I chose for this enhancement was yet again my Corner Grocer project from CS 210.  This project was a simple C++ application that tracks the frequency of purchased grocery items by reading a text file and giving counts for each item or specific items.  I made a version that uses Python for file-reading and data processing logic, while using C++ for the user interface and output.  This combination allowed me to experiment with integrating two programming languages and strengthened my skills in cross-language software design.
Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio.  Why did you select this item?  What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development?  How as the artifact improved?
I included this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to improve an existing piece of software by adding persistence, structure, and reliable data access.  The enhancement transformed the project from a basic file-based script into something much closer to a practical application.  The move from text files to SQLite shows that I can work with databases, design tables, write parameterized queries, and think about performance and security.  The artifact improved significantly.  Instead of re-reading the input file and recomputing frequencies every time the user calls a function, the program now stores all item counts in an SQLite database.  On the first run, it automatically migrates the original data into the new database, and every future run is faster and more secure because the program pulls data directly from a structured table.  This aligns closely with the enhancement plan I wrote earlier in the course.  
Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One?  Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
This enhancement fully meets the outcomes I planned in Module One.  I demonstrated skills in security by designing software that prevents vulnerabilities, using parameterized SQL queries that protect against injection attacks, and switching to a structured database to prevent data corruption issues that could happen with plain text files.  The cdoe still works with the existing C++ menu the same way.  There are no changes to my planned outcome coverage for this milestone.  
Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact.  What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it?  What challenges did you face?
The enhancement process taught me important lessons in proper data storage and how much of a difference it makes.  I got more experience setting up SQLite tables, handling data migration automatically, and writing queries that are both fast and secure.  The caching system also showed me how to have a fallback planned in case the database isn’t built yet.  One challenge was making sure the program worked whether the database existed already or needed to be created.  I had to carefully plan the startup flow so it would migrate from the text file on the first run but use the database afterward.  Another challenge was the SQL syntax as it is different from the other Python code around it.  Overall, this made me much more comfortable working with databases and thinking about data persistence in real applications.
