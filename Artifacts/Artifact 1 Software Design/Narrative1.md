CS 499 Capstone Artifact 1
1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I chose to enhance is the “Corner Grocer” project, originally created last year for CS 210.  This project was a simple C++ application that tracks the frequency of purchased grocery items by reading a text file and giving counts for each item or specific items.  I made a version that uses Python for file-reading and data processing logic, while using C++ for the user interface and output.  This combination allowed me to experiment with integrating two programming languages and strengthened my skills in cross-language software design.  
2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates key skills in software development, including file input/output, basic data processing, and language integration.  These are core building blocks for many backend systems.  The original project used a procedural approach, making it suitable for significant improvement.  For this enhancement, I refactored the Python portion from procedural logic into an object-oriented design using an ItemTracker class.  This update emphasizes better encapsulation, code modularity, and maintainability.  It also introduced error handling for data access, improved clarity of the code, and kept backward compatibility for easier integration with existing C++ code.  The enhanced version provides a more robust and scalable foundation for further upgrades, such as eventually migrating from text files to a database.  

3. Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
This enhancement fully meets the outcomes I planned in Module One.  I demonstrated skills in object-oriented design by using classes to encapsulate logic, improved software architecture for better maintainability, and created a clear interface between C++ and Python.  The enhanced code aligns with the course outcome of applying well-founded and innovative techniques and tools in real computing practices.  There are no changes to my planned outcome coverage for this milestone.  
4. Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

The enhancement process taught me important lessons in code organization and maintainability.  Refactoring procedural code to use classes made the code clearer and easier to work with, while also paving the way for future changes like database integration or more complex user interactions.  One challenge I faced was setting up the Python integration environment after switching computers.  I ended up adjusting directory paths and renaming files to avoid conflicts, such as renaming “Python.py” to “PythonCode.py” to avoid breaking imports.  I learned how crucial error handling is for user experience and for narrowing down problems to find them.  I also learned how important it is to keep code readable and commented for future development or for others who may work with it.  Overall, the process increased my confidence in applying software engineering principles and in managing cross-language projects that are robust, maintainable, and extensible.
